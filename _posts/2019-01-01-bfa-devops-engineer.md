## Overview

Joined **BFA (Beauty For All Industries)** as a DevOps Engineer, managing infrastructure for one of the largest beauty subscription e-commerce platforms. Supported 40 million concurrent users and led a major database migration from PostgreSQL to MongoDB.

## Key Responsibilities

### Infrastructure Management
- Managed infrastructure supporting 40M concurrent users
- Built and maintained Kubernetes clusters
- Implemented auto-scaling for peak traffic periods
- Designed disaster recovery and backup strategies

### Database Migration
- Led PostgreSQL to MongoDB migration project
- Planned zero-downtime migration strategy
- Implemented data synchronization pipelines
- Optimized MongoDB queries for performance

### DevOps Pipelines
- Built CI/CD pipelines for microservices
- Implemented infrastructure as code with Terraform
- Set up monitoring and alerting systems
- Created developer tooling and workflows

## Technical Challenges

### Scale Management
BFA operated at massive scale:
- 40 million concurrent users during peak events
- Thousands of transactions per second
- Petabytes of product and user data
- Global content delivery requirements

### Database Migration
The PostgreSQL to MongoDB migration was one of the most complex projects:
- Zero downtime requirement
- Data consistency validation
- Query optimization for document structure
- Gradual rollout with rollback capability

### High Availability
- Multi-region deployments
- Database replication and failover
- CDN integration for static assets
- Real-time monitoring and alerting

## Technologies

- **Cloud**: AWS (EKS, RDS, S3, CloudFront, Route53)
- **Containers**: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm
- **IaC**: Terraform, Ansible
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch
- **Monitoring**: Datadog, PagerDuty, CloudWatch
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, ArgoCD

## Key Achievements

### 40M User Scale
- Successfully handled 40M concurrent users
- Achieved 99.99% uptime during peak events
- Reduced infrastructure costs by 30%

### Database Migration
- Completed zero-downtime PostgreSQL to MongoDB migration
- Improved query performance by 40%
- Reduced database operational costs
- Enabled horizontal scaling of data layer

## Learnings

Working at BFA taught me:
- **Scale Operations**: Managing infrastructure at massive scale
- **Migration Strategy**: Planning and executing major data migrations
- **Cost Optimization**: Balancing performance with infrastructure costs
- **Team Coordination**: Working with engineering teams during transitions

## Transition

After BFA, moved into blockchain consulting with Dcycle and later founded Euler Tools, bringing DevOps best practices to Web3 infrastructure.
