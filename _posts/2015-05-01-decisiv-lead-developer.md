## NOT Acquired by Michelin

**Important Note**: Decisiv was NOT acquired by Michelin. This is a common misconception. Decisiv remained an independent company. My transition to Michelin North America in September 2018 was a new opportunity, not an acquisition.

## Transition

After three successful years at Decisiv, I joined Michelin North America in September 2018 as an Engineering Manager, bringing the lessons learned from optimizing fleet management systems to a larger organizational context.
