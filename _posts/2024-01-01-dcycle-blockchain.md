## Overview

Joined **Dcycle** as a DevOps Engineer and Infrastructure Architect, building and maintaining infrastructure for Web3 companies and blockchain projects. Combined my DevOps expertise with blockchain knowledge to deliver scalable, secure Web3 infrastructure.

## Key Responsibilities

### Infrastructure Architecture
- Designed cloud infrastructure for blockchain applications
- Implemented Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- Built scalable node infrastructure for blockchain networks
- Established security frameworks for Web3 deployments

### DevOps Excellence
- Created CI/CD pipelines for smart contract deployments
- Implemented monitoring and alerting for blockchain nodes
- Built automated backup and disaster recovery systems
- Optimized infrastructure costs for Web3 workloads

### Blockchain Infrastructure
- Deployed and managed Ethereum and EVM-compatible nodes
- Built infrastructure for NFT marketplaces and DeFi protocols
- Implemented wallet infrastructure and key management
- Created secure environments for smart contract testing

## Technology Stack

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| **Cloud** | AWS, Google Cloud Platform |
| **IaC** | Terraform, OpenTofu, Ansible |
| **Containers** | Docker, Kubernetes |
| **Blockchain** | Ethereum, Polygon, EVM chains |
| **Monitoring** | Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog |
| **Security** | Vault, KMS, HSM |

## Key Projects

### NFT Marketplace Infrastructure
- Built scalable infrastructure for NFT minting and trading platforms
- Implemented IPFS pinning and content delivery
- Created automated deployment pipelines for marketplace contracts
- **Result**: Supported 100K+ NFT mints with 99.9% uptime

### DeFi Protocol Infrastructure
- Deployed infrastructure for lending and yield farming protocols
- Implemented price oracle infrastructure
- Built monitoring for on-chain events and alerts
- **Result**: Secured $10M+ TVL across protocols

### Blockchain Node Operations
- Deployed Ethereum archive nodes for data analytics
- Built redundant node infrastructure for high availability
- Implemented automated node updates and maintenance
- **Result**: 99.99% node availability

## Infrastructure Highlights

### Security Architecture
- Implemented multi-sig wallet infrastructure
- Created secure key management with HSM integration
- Established network segmentation for blockchain nodes
- Built audit logging for all infrastructure changes

### Cost Optimization
- Optimized blockchain node storage costs by 40%
- Implemented spot instance usage for batch workloads
- Right-sized compute resources based on actual usage
- **Result**: 35% reduction in monthly infrastructure costs

### Automation
- Automated smart contract deployment pipelines
- Built infrastructure provisioning with Terraform
- Created self-healing node infrastructure
- Implemented automated security scanning

## Learnings

This role deepened my understanding of:
- **Web3 Infrastructure**: Specialized requirements for blockchain apps
- **Node Operations**: Running reliable blockchain infrastructure
- **Security**: Protecting digital assets at scale
- **Cost Management**: Balancing decentralization with efficiency

## Transition

After Dcycle, moved into infrastructure architecture roles, bringing Web3 infrastructure best practices to traditional cloud environments at Tribbu.
