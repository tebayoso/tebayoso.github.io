## Overview

Joined **Certchain Limited** as a Founding Engineer, building an EVM-compatible blockchain forked from Ethereum for digital identity and certification. This was a ground-up blockchain project combining Web3 technology with real-world use cases.

## Key Responsibilities

### Blockchain Development
- Forked Ethereum to create custom EVM-compatible blockchain
- Implemented custom consensus mechanisms
- Optimized block processing and transaction throughput
- Built blockchain explorer and monitoring tools

### Smart Contract Architecture
- Designed smart contract architecture for digital identity
- Built certification and verification contracts in Solidity
- Implemented access control and permission systems
- Created upgradeable contract patterns

### Full-Stack Application
- Built React frontend for certificate management
- Developed Node.js backend for blockchain interaction
- Integrated Web3 wallets and transaction signing
- Implemented IPFS for decentralized document storage

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- Set up blockchain node infrastructure on AWS
- Implemented network monitoring and alerting
- Built deployment pipelines for smart contracts
- Managed testnet and mainnet deployments

## Technical Architecture

### Custom Blockchain
- Forked from Ethereum go-ethereum client
- Modified consensus for permissioned network
- Adjusted block time and gas mechanisms
- Implemented custom precompiled contracts

### Smart Contracts
- Identity registry contracts
- Certificate issuance and revocation
- Verification and attestation system
- Multi-signature governance

### Application Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Web3.js, Ethers.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, GraphQL
- **Storage**: IPFS, PostgreSQL (off-chain data)
- **Cloud**: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes

## Key Achievements

### EVM Blockchain
- Successfully launched custom EVM-compatible chain
- Achieved 3-second block times
- Processed 1000+ TPS in testing

### Digital Identity Platform
- Built complete digital identity solution
- Integrated with existing certificate authorities
- Created verification API for third parties

### Team Building
- Helped hire initial engineering team
- Established development practices
- Created technical documentation

## Technologies

- **Blockchain**: Solidity, EVM, Ethereum, Go
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Web3.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, GraphQL, PostgreSQL
- **Storage**: IPFS, S3
- **Cloud**: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Tools**: Hardhat, Foundry, OpenZeppelin

## Learnings

Founding Certchain taught me:
- **Blockchain Deep Dive**: Understanding EVM internals
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Trade-offs in blockchain design
- **Identity Systems**: The complexity of digital identity
- **Startup Velocity**: Moving fast with limited resources
- **Regulatory Awareness**: Compliance in blockchain applications

## Transition

After Certchain, joined MetaLab as Software Architect while continuing to advise on blockchain projects and eventually joining Sharpei as Lead Developer.
