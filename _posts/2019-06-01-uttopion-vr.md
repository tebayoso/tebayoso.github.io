## Overview

**Uttopion** was a virtual reality platform project where I served as Lead Developer, building immersive VR experiences and the underlying platform infrastructure.

## Key Features

### VR Platform Development
- Built backend infrastructure for VR content distribution
- Implemented user authentication and session management
- Created APIs for VR device integration

### Content Management System
- Designed CMS for VR content creators
- Built asset pipeline for 3D models
- Implemented versioning system for VR experiences

### Multiplayer Features
- Real-time synchronization for multiplayer VR
- Voice chat integration
- Spatial audio implementation

## Technology Stack

```
Backend:        Node.js, Socket.io
Database:       MongoDB, Redis
VR Framework:   Unity (C#)
Cloud:          AWS (EC2, S3)
Networking:     WebRTC, Socket.io
```

## Challenges

- **Latency**: Minimizing motion-to-photon latency for VR comfort
- **Scale**: Supporting concurrent users in shared VR spaces
- **Cross-platform**: Supporting multiple VR headsets

## Outcome

Successfully launched beta platform with:
- 10+ VR experiences
- Real-time multiplayer support
- Cross-platform compatibility (Oculus, HTC Vive, PSVR)

## Transition

This experience informed my later work on **Motosierra Studio**, particularly around game development and real-time systems.
